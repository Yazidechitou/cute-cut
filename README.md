# cute-cut
Personal Project

---ABOUT THE PROJECT---

Almost anyone who's been to a barbershop has had a bad haircut experience. It happens to barbers too. They definitely have their share of terrible barbershop experiences — double bookings, no-shows, last-minute cancellations, and an inbox of the "can you fit me in" text's from their clients. 

I noticed that customers complain about difficulties in terms of their working hours overlapping with barber shop hours. They also complain about long waiting time to get their hair cuts. They only have the possibility of having their hair cut during weekends since they work on weekdays. I am trying to correct this problem. 

My website is to make a haircut simple, painless and risk-free. 
The website will help service providers to create their online presence once and use it to attract and book as many clients as they want/can handle. 
It will save booking headaches and give clients the convenience they expect with online booking. The service providers will set their availabilities, and let the clients choose from these availabilities when they use the search features. The application will be there to facilitate customer access to service providers because they can perform services at clients’ choice of place.
